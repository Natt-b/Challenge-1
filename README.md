# Challenge-1
HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor: On-the-job ticket
This was my first Challenge to refactor an existing site for a marketing agency to make it more accessible.
Refactoring the website makes it more acessible for users and minimises pain points. 
I had learnt a lot during this challenge:
I practiced more with my CSS 
Ensuring that HTML and CSS are in sync to make it work
Learnt some semantic elements and how to integrate them and get rid of divs 
What I fixed:
Refactored HTML to use semantic elements 
added alt elements to icons and images
Added a title to the website 
Fixed the 'search engine optimization'link
